# hairdresser
This project showcases a website I developed for a hairdresser,                  aimed at practicing and enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.                  The website features a user-friendly design, responsive layout, and interactive                  elements to provide a seamless experience for visitors.
